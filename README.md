# Etch-a-Sketch

Use html, css, and Javascript to build a program that creates a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch.

***
## NOTES
* use 2 for loops to create enough divs through javascript to make the grid, and placed within the container div.
* start off with 16x16 grid formatted with flexbox.
* use addEventListener to run the function mouseOver which adds a class assigned a different background color.
* add a button to prompt the user for a new number to redraw a new grid.


### Function mouseOver()
Add class to the targeted div, to add different styling to the background color.

### Function drawGrid()
Draw the first 16x16 grid uses 2 for loops to create 16 columns each with 16 items.

### Function redrawGrid()
Prompts user for number to determine the size of the new grid and then calls the function drawGrid().
